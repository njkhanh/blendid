**Blendid** is a delicious stand-alone blend of tasks and build tools that form a full-featured modern asset pipeline. It can be used as-is as a static site builder, or can be configured and integrated into your own development environment and site or app structure.

## Quick start on a fresh project (empty directory)
```bash
yarn init
yarn add git://github.com/njkhanh/blendid.git
yarn blendid init
yarn blendid
```

This will create default src and config files in your directory and start compiling and live-updating files! Try editing them and watch your browser auto-update!
